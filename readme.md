# What is this?

I made this discord bot for a joke. It "replaces" someone by taking their name (or something close). besides taking their name their are a few / commands to mimic the targets replcement on demand. It also has a chance to mock what the target says to it, or praise what someone else says.

## Usage

Please only use this on someone with a good sense of humor that won't be seriously offended. This is a tool of annoyance, not of bullying.

## Default Operation

### Phase 1:

Every time someone makes a message in the target channel the bot has a chance to praise and encorage them. However, if the message sender is the target user then the bot has a chance to mimic the message in WhAcKy CaSe with a random mocking phrase adding to the insult.

### Phase 2:

Phase 2 is the same as phase 1, but now the bot also has a chance of copying the message sent by the target then deleting the orginal message. This is so it kind of seems like the bot is slowly replacing the person

### Phase 3:

In phase 3 messages are copied then deleted like in phase 2, but this always hapens now instead of by chance. Also the bot will no longer mock the target.

## Random Fun Commands

You can also interact directly with the bot by sending it various slash commands, it will respond with a phraise taken from from the database.

#### Catchphrase:

Returns a random catch phrase from the database

#### Define:

Returns a defintion based on the word you ask to be defined

#### Share:

Returns a random link from the database

## Useful commands

#### Redisguise:

The bot will apply the current nickname of the target with "2.0" added to the end

#### Ping:

Check that the bot is running.

#### Server Info:

Display some information of the server

## How to use
