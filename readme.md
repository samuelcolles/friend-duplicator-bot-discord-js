### What is this?

I made this discord bot for a joke. It "replaces" someone by taking their name (or something close). besides taking their name their are a few / commands to mimic the targets replcement on demand. It also has a chance to mock what the target says to it, or praise what someone else says.

### Current Slash commands

/catch_phrase -Say a catch phrase from the exampleCatchPhrase array
/define example -provide a word to define, if it is on the list the bot will define it, if it is not on the list the bot will say something sassy.
/share - the bot will post a random link from its list of links
/ping - test the bot, it also pretends that something is being checked, but it is just a message that gets edited on a timer

### How to use

1. Follow the getting started section of discord.js (or some other guide) on creating bots using the discord developer portal. You will need some information from it to provide to the .env file.
2. Enable developer mode in the discord client, this will make copying ID's of server's and users much easier
3. Download and unzip this project someone
4. Change the name of the "example.env" file to just ".env"
5. Populate the field in the .env file with information from the discord developer portal
6. install node/npm if not already installed
7. open a terminal to the root of the project and run "npm run dev"
8. Annoy your friend!
